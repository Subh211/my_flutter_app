I developed a comprehensive login and signup system using Firebase as the backend, incorporating Google Sign-In for a seamless user experience. The home page of the app displays news cards fetched directly from an API, with a feature to search for news based on titles. I chose Firebase for its robust authentication services, real-time database capabilities, and ease of integration, which significantly streamlined the development process and ensured secure and efficient user management. This project demonstrates a practical application of user authentication and dynamic data fetching in a modern web application.
